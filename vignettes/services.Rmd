# Services examples

## Specimen occurrence services {.tabset} 

Specimen records constitute the core of data served by the NBA. Museum
specimens can represent a whole variety of different objects such as
plants, animals or single parts thereof, DNA samples, fossils, rocks
or meteorites. For detailed information of the data model, please
refer to the
[official documentation in the NBA](http://docs.biodiversitydata.nl/en/latest/doc-spec-services/specimen/).

All specimen occurrence services are accessible using the methods
within the `SpecimenClient` class.  For a list of available endpoints,
please refer to the class documentation (`?Specimen`). Below, we will
give details about all services, grouped by category.

### Query services

#### query

Querying for specimens is accomplished with the `query` method in the
class `SpecimenClient`. For simple queries, query parameters of type
`list` can be passed via the parameter `queryParams`, for example we
can query specimens of the Family *Ebenaceae* that were collected in
Europe:

```{r}
library("nbaR")

# instantiate specimen client
sc <- SpecimenClient$new()

# specify query params in named list
qp <-
  list(
    identifications.defaultClassification.family = "Ebenaceae",
    gatheringEvent.continent = "Europe"
  )

# query
res <- sc$query(queryParams = qp)
```

If we now want to know all the countries that the specimens were
collected in, we can access the `Specimen` objects in
```res$content$resultSet``` as follows:

```{r}
sapply(res$content$resultSet, function(x) x$item$gatheringEvent$country)
```

Note that passing query parameters as a named list only allows for
limited queries; the logical conjunction between parameters is for
example always `AND`. More complex queries can be accomplished using
the `QuerySpec` object:

```{r}
# get all specimens with genus name starting with 'Hydro'
qc <-
  QueryCondition$new(
    field = "identifications.defaultClassification.genus",
    operator = "STARTS_WITH",
    value = "Hydro"
  )
qs <- QuerySpec$new(conditions = list(qc))
res <- sc$query(qs)
```

#### download_query

The `query` function is limited to retrieve 50000 specimen at once
(this is determined in the parameter `index.max_result_window`, the
value is retrievable using the `getSettings` method in the metadata
section). In order to provide access for a larger amount of data, the
`query_download` takes the same arguments as `query`, but download the
data as a gzip stream under the hood.  Unlike `query`,
`query_download` returns a list of specimen objects instead of a
`ResultSet`.  Example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## get the first 100000 specimen objects (not possible with query method)
res <- sc$download_query(QuerySpec$new(size = 100000))
```

### Data access services

Several access methods offer the convenient retrieval of specimens
matching a certain identifier or being part of a certain
collection. Below we give examples of how to use the currently
implemented data access services for specimen records:

#### Access to collections

Some of the specimens available via the NBA are categorised
thematically into special collections, such as the Siebold-, Dubois-
or Jongmans collection.  The function `get_named_collection` lists all
available special collections and the identifiers of the specimens
within a collection can be queries with `get_ids_in_collection`

```{r}
sc$get_named_collections()$content
sc$get_ids_in_collection("siebold")$content
```

#### count

For any given query (with `QuerySpec` or not), returns the count of
matches instead of specimen objects:

```{r}
# Example with QuerySpec:
# how many specimens are there in the 'Botany' collection?
qc <- QueryCondition$new(field = "collectionType", operator = "EQUALS", value = "Botany")
qs <- QuerySpec$new(conditions = list(qc))

# get the number of specimens
sc$count(qs)$content
```

Note that the count of matches for a given query is also returned by
the `query` function. However, `count` is more lightweight as it
returns an `integer` instead of a `ResultSet` containing `Specimen`
objects.

#### exists 

Check if a record exists, based on its *unitID*:

```{r}
# use SpecimenClient instantiated above
res <- sc$exists("ZMA.INS.1255440")

# content is boolean
res$content
```

#### find 

Return a single specimen given its identifier (Note: the identifier of
a specimen is different from the unitID, see also
[here](http://docs.biodiversitydata.nl/en/latest/doc-spec-services/specimen/#specids)):

```{r}
id <- "RMNH.MAM.17209.B@CRS"
res <- sc$find(id)

# content is single specimen object
res$content
```

#### find_by_ids

Same as `find`, but takes multiple IDs:

```{r}
ids <- "RMNH.INS.657083@CRS,L.1589244@BRAHMS"
res <- sc$find_by_ids(ids)
```

#### find_by_unit_id

Find a specimen by its `unitID`:
```{r}
unitID <- "RMNH.MAM.1513"
res <- sc$find_by_unit_id(unitID)
```

### Aggregation services

Aggregation services group available data according to different
criteria.

#### get_distinct_values

This method takes a specific field as an argument and returns all
possible values and the frequency for that field in the data. Below we
get all possible values for the country in which a specimen was
collected.

```{r results='hide'}
sc$get_distinct_values("gatheringEvent.country")
```

**Note**: By default, `get_distinct_values` lists only the first 10
hits. The above query thus does not reflect the distinct values in the
hole dataset.  This number can be increased with e.g. setting the
`size` parameter in a `QuerySpec` object passed to the method.

```{r results='hide'}
sc$get_distinct_values("gatheringEvent.country",
  querySpec = QuerySpec$new(size = 10000)
)
```	

#### count_distinct_values

Instead of returning all different values for a given field, this
method does a mere count:

```{r results='hide'}
sc$count_distinct_values("gatheringEvent.country")
```

#### get_distinct_values_per_group

Suppose you want to add another filter to the above query of
retrieving all distinct values for a given field, such as splitting
the results by their respective source system:

```{r results='hide'}
sc$get_distinct_values_per_group("sourceSystem.name", "gatheringEvent.country")
```

#### count_distinct_values_per_group

If no return of the actual values is needed, a simple count per group
is done as follows:

```{r results='hide'}
sc$count_distinct_values_per_group(
  "sourceSystem.name",
  "gatheringEvent.country"
)$content
```

### Metadata services

Specimen Metadata services include the same standard metadata services
as for the other data types:

```{r}
# get all paths for the Specimen datatype
sc$get_paths()$content

# get info e.g. for field collectionType
sc$get_field_info()$content$collectionType

# get all settings
sc$get_settings()

# get specific setting
sc$get_setting("index.max_result_window")$content

# check if operator is allowed
sc$is_operator_allowed("gatheringEvent.continent", "STARTS_WITH")$content
```


#### Available paths and fields

All fields can be retrieved with `get_paths` and specific information
on the fields, such as allowed operators etc. with `get_field_info`

```{r results='hide'}
sc$get_paths()$content
sc$get_field_info()$content
```

#### Settings

Multimedia-specific settings can be retrieved with `get_settings` and
a specific setting with `get_setting`:

```{r}
sc$get_settings()$content
sc$get_setting("index.max_result_window")$content
```

#### Operators

To test if a certain operator can be used for a multimedia query:

```{r}
sc$is_operator_allowed(
  "identifications.defaultClassification.genus",
  "STARTS_WITH"
)$content
```

### DwCA download services

In addition to query services that return JSON formatted data, the NBA
also offers the export of
[Darwin Core Archive (DwCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Core_Archive)
files.  These files are by default zip archives, please refer to our
[official API documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_Core_Archive)
for more information.

#### Static download 

Static download services offer the download of predefined datasets.
The sets that are available for download can be queried with
`dwca_get_data_set_names`:

```{r}
sc$dwca_get_data_set_names()$content
```

A dataset can then be downloaded using `dwca_get_data_set`. A filename
can be given as argument, if none is given, the DwCA archive is
written to *download-YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm.zip* in the current working
directory.

```{r results='hide'}
# download dataset 'porifera' to temporary file
filename <- tempfile(fileext = ".zip")
sc$dwca_get_data_set("porifera", filename = filename)
```

#### Dynamic download

The dynamic download function `dwca_query` allows for download of
arbitrary sets, defined by the user's query.  The arguments to this
methods are similar to `query`, plus the filename:

```{r results='hide'}
# download all specimen of genus 'Hydrochoerus'
filename <- tempfile(fileext = ".zip")
qs <-
  QuerySpec$new(conditions = list(
    QueryCondition$new(
      field = "identifications.defaultClassification.genus",
      operator = "EQUALS",
      value = "Hydrochoerus"
    )
  ))
sc$dwca_query(querySpec = qs, filename = filename)
```

## Taxonomic data services {.tabset}

### Query Services

#### query

Query for taxon document with given search criteria. Example:

```{r results='hide'}
# query for taxa of genus 'Sedum' that are in the Netherlands Soortenregister (NSR)
tc <- TaxonClient$new()
qc <-
  QueryCondition$new(
    field = "acceptedName.genusOrMonomial",
    operator = "EQUALS",
    value = "Sedum"
  )
qc2 <-
  QueryCondition$new(
    field = "sourceSystem.code",
    operator = "EQUALS",
    value = "NSR"
  )
qs <- QuerySpec$new(conditions = list(qc, qc2))
tc$query(qs)
```

#### download_query

The `query` function is limited to retrieve 50000 taxa at once (this
is determined in the parameter `index.max_result_window`, the value is
retrievable using the `getSettings` method in the metadata
section). In order to provide access for a larger amount of data, the
`query_download` takes the same arguments as `query`, but download the
data as a gzip stream under the hood.  Unlike `query`,
`query_download` returns a list of taxon objects instead of a
`ResultSet`.

### Data access services

#### count

For a given query, do not return `Taxon` objects but the mere
count. Example

```{r}
# get counts for taxa of genus 'Sedum' that are in the
#  Netherlands Soortenregister (NSR)
qc <-
  QueryCondition$new(
    field = "acceptedName.genusOrMonomial",
    operator = "EQUALS",
    value = "Sedum"
  )
qc2 <-
  QueryCondition$new(
    field = "sourceSystem.code",
    operator = "EQUALS",
    value = "NSR"
  )
qs <- QuerySpec$new(conditions = list(qc, qc2))
tc$count(qs)
```

#### find

Returns a taxon object given its identifier:

```{r}
tc$find("27706109@COL")$content
```

#### find_by_ids

Given a string with comma-separated identifiers, returns a list of
taxon objects:

```{r}
ids <- "27706109@COL,27704140@COL,27706110@COL,27706111@COL,27706108@COL"
res <- tc$find_by_ids(ids)
```		

### Aggregation services

#### get_distinct_values

This method takes a specific field as an argument and returns all
possible values and the frequency for that field in the data. Example:
get all data source systems for taxon objects:

```{r}
tc$get_distinct_values("sourceSystem.name")$content
```

### Metadata services

Taxon Metadata services include the same standard metadata services as
for the other data types:

```{r}
# get all paths for the Taxon datatype
tc$get_paths()$content

# get info e.g. for field collectionType
tc$get_field_info()$content$synonyms.author

# get all settings
tc$get_settings()

# get specific setting
tc$get_setting("index.max_result_window")$content

# check if operator is allowed
tc$is_operator_allowed("synonyms.author", "EQUALS")$content
```

#### Available paths and fields

All fields can be retrieved with `get_paths` and specific information
on the fields, such as allowed operators etc. with `get_field_info`

```{r results='hide'}
tc$get_paths()$content
tc$get_field_info()$content
```

#### Settings

Multimedia-specific settings can be retrieved with `get_settings` and
a specific setting with `get_setting`:

```{r}
tc$get_settings()$content
tc$get_setting("index.max_result_window")$content
```

#### Operators

To test if a certain operator can be used for a mutimedia query:

```{r}
tc$is_operator_allowed(
  "identifications.defaultClassification.genus",
  "STARTS_WITH"
)$content
```

### DwCA download services

The taxonomic information in the NBA is also available as Darwin-Core
archive files.

#### Static download 

Static download services offer the download of predefined datasets.
The sets that are available for download can be queried with
`dwca_get_data_set_names`:

```{r}
tc$dwca_get_data_set_names()$content
```

A dataset can then be downloaded using `dwca_get_data_set`. A filename
can be given as argument, if none is given, the DwCA archive is
written to *download-YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm.zip* in the current working
directory.

```{r results='hide'}
# download dataset 'nsr' to temporary file
filename <- tempfile(fileext = ".zip")
tc$dwca_get_data_set("nsr", filename = filename)
```

#### Dynamic download

The dynamic download function `dwca_query` allows for download of
arbitrary sets, defined by the user's query.  The arguments to this
methods are similar to `query`, plus the filename:

```{r results='hide'}
# download all taxa for genus 'Clematis'
filename <- tempfile(fileext = ".zip")
qs <-
  QuerySpec$new(conditions = list(
    QueryCondition$new(
      field = "defaultClassification.genus",
      operator = "EQUALS",
      value = "Clematis"
    )
  ))
tc$dwca_query(querySpec = qs, filename = filename)
```

## Geographic data services {.tabset}

### Query Services

The GeoArea query service allows for detailed search within the fields
of a GeoArea object. As for the other data types, query parameters can
be either given as a `list` or as a `QuerySpec` object.  Below, we
make a simple query to get the `GeoArea` object for the Netherlands:

```{r}
# instantiate client for geo areas
gc <- GeoClient$new()

# query for GeoArea of the Netherlands
qc <-
  QueryCondition$new(
    field = "locality",
    operator = "EQUALS",
    value = "Netherlands"
  )
qs <- QuerySpec$new(conditions = list(qc))
res <- gc$query(qs)

# get item
res$content$resultSet[[1]]$item
```

### Data access services

#### get_geo_json_for_locality

This is a convenience function to directly extract the a GeoJSON
object for a specific
locality. [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON) is a
popular format for storing geographical point- and polygon data.  To
e.g. extract the GeoJSON polygon representation for the Netherlands:

```{r results='hide'}
loc <- "Netherlands"
res <- gc$get_geo_json_for_locality(loc)
```

Results are returned as a `list` by default, but can be easily converted to 
a JSON string, e.g.

```{r results='hide'}
jsonlite::toJSON(res$content)
```

#### count

For any given query (with `QuerySpec` or not), returns the count of
matches instead of `GeoArea` objects:

```{r}
# return count of all GeoAreas
res <- gc$count()
res$content
```

### Aggregation services

#### get_distinct_values

This function returns all values present for a certain field, and
their counts:

```{r}
gc$get_distinct_values("areaType")$content
```

### Metadata services

Geo Metadata services include the same standard metadata services as
for the other data types:

```{r}
# get all paths for the GeoArea datatype
gc$get_paths()$content

# get info e.g. for field 'areaType'
gc$get_field_info()$content$areaType

# get all settings
gc$get_settings()

# get specific setting
gc$get_setting("index.max_result_window")$content

# check if operator is allowed
gc$is_operator_allowed("locality", "STARTS_WITH")$content
```

## Multimedia services {.tabset}

Multimedia services are accessible with a `MultimediaClient`,
instantiated as follows:

```{r}
mc <- MultimediaClient$new()
```

### Query Services

As for the other data types, the `query` method enables simple and
complex queries using a list or a `QuerySpec` object to specify query
parameters.

```{r}
# example of multimedia query passing parameters as a list
mc$query(queryParams = list(collectionType = "Cnidaria"))$content

# example of multimedia query using QuerySpec: get the first 100
# multimedia items associated with a specimen with name starting with "Ba"
qc <-
  QueryCondition$new(
    field =
      "identifications.scientificName.fullScientificName",
    operator =
      "STARTS_WITH",
    value =
      "Qu"
  )
qs <- QuerySpec$new(conditions = list(qc), size = 100)
res <- mc$query(qs)

# check if scientific names indeed start with 'Qu'
sapply(res$content$resultSet, function(x) {
  x$item$identifications[[1]]$scientificName$fullScientificName
})
```

### Data access services

#### count

As for the other data types, a `count` function returns counts instead
of the actual objects:

```{r}
# count all multimedia documents
mc$count()$content
```

### Aggregation services

#### get_distinct_values

This function returns all values present for a certain field, and
their counts. Example: retrieve all different licenses and their
counts"

```{r}
mc$get_distinct_values("license")$content
```

### Metadata services

#### Available paths and fields

All fields can be retrieved with `get_paths` and specific information
on the fields, such as allowed operators etc. with `get_field_info`

```{r results='hide'}
mc$get_paths()$content
mc$get_field_info()$content
```

#### Settings

Multimedia-specific settings can be retrieved with `get_settings` and
a specific setting with `get_setting`:

```{r}
mc$get_settings()$content
mc$get_setting("index.max_result_window")$content
```

#### Operators

To test if a certain operator can be used for a mutimedia query:

```{r}
mc$is_operator_allowed(
  "identifications.scientificName.fullScientificName",
  "STARTS_WITH"
)$content
```

## Metadata services {.tabset}

Metadata services provide miscellaneous information about the data
available via the NBA. Note that there is also type-specific metadata
for each data type (e.g. `Specimen`) which can be retrieved with the
specific client of that class. Here we show the available methods for
the `MetadataClient` which gives general, non-type specific metadata.
The client is instantiated in the standard way:

```{r}
mc <- MetadataClient$new()
```


#### Controlled vocabularies

The vocabularies for some fields are controlled by dictionaries with
allowed values. For the sex of a museum specimen, for instance, only
the terms *male*, *female*, *mixed* and *hermaphrodite* are allowed to
be assigned to the specimen.  The fields for which controlled lists
are available can be retrieved as follows:

```{r}
mc$get_controlled_lists()$content
```

and for each field that has a controlled vocabulary, there is a
separate function to retrieve the allowed values:

```{r}
mc$get_controlled_list_taxonomic_status()$content
mc$get_controlled_list_specimen_type_status()$content
mc$get_controlled_list_sex()$content
mc$get_controlled_list_phase_or_stage()$content
```

#### Miscellaneous

##### Dates

To maintain data integrity, dates have to be coded in specific formats
in our systems. For instance, *yyyy-MM-dd* is a valid format.  Allowed
formats can be retrieved as follows:

```{r}
mc$get_allowed_date_formats()$content
```

##### Services list

The method `get_rest_services` returns a list of all services in the
NBA as objects of type `RestService`.

```{r}
# get the endPoint of the first rest service in the services list
mc$get_rest_services()$content[[1]]
```

##### Settings

Similar to the document-specific metadata services, we can get general
settings with the `MetaDataClient`:

```{r}
# get all settings
mc$get_settings()$content

# get value for specific setting
mc$get_setting("operator.contains.min_term_length")$content
```
