Hi @sckott @DomBennett @mbjoseph, 
thank you for the thorough evaluation of the package. 
The new version of the [nbaR package](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR) 
aims to address all of these issues. For a better overview, I cpoied your comment into github issues summarised in the milestone [Ropenscience-revision](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3ARopenscience-revision). 
This resulted in the following major changes: 

**Wrapper functions**
The package now features low-level API access using function wrappers which are 
more easy to use. For each endpoint, there is one wrapper which can be called directly without any `QuerySpec`, `QueryCondition` etc. objects. For complex structures, the wrappers return native R datatypes, such as `data.frame` (with list columns) or `list` (types are configurable by the user) instead of `R6` objects such as `Specimen` or `Taxon`. Documentation on the wrappers can be found in the [reference](https://naturalis.github.io/nbaR/reference/index.html) and further description is provided in the [get started vignette](https://naturalis.github.io/nbaR/articles/nbaR.html).

This is documented in the following issues: [#18](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/18), [#32](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/32), [#34](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/34)

**Documentation**
* The main vignette has been split into smaller parts. Documentation is now spread over 5 pages: *Getting started*, *Objects and advanced queries*, *services summary*, *sharks workflow*, *tomato workflow* ([issue #17](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/17), [issue #36](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/36), [issue #34](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/34)).
* Help files: Have been improved. Extended descriptions have been added for the main model datatypes (`Specimen`, `Taxon`, `Multimedia`, `Geo` and also for `QuerySpec` and `QueryCondition`). These changes have to be made in the code annotations of the API itself, therefore not yet all of the classes are documented in detail. Since I am not the developer of the API, this has to be communicated and done by someone else; we are working on completing more descriptions. However, many classes will never be used by the `nbaR` user: For example, almost no records have a `LithoStratigraphy` field, thus the user will in most cases not come across this object.([issue #24](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/24)). 
* More information on operators is now given in the [vignette](https://naturalis.github.io/nbaR/articles/apiclient.html#operators) ([issue #28](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/28)).
* Typos: [issue #46](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/46), [issue #35](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/35).
* Different clients are now better explained: ([issue #45](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/45)).
* Pkdown issues have been resolved. In addition, client classes and model classes are now better organised in the [reference page](https://naturalis.github.io/nbaR/reference/index.html) ([issue #23](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/23)).
* Character length in vignette code has been reduced to max 80 chrs per line ([issue #37](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/37)).
* Empty query example at start of vignette has been removed ([issue #38](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/38)).
* Size argument now better explained in shark vignette ([issue #47](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/47)).

**Tests/Checks/Coverage**
* Unit tests failed if the NBA was down, thus we now do a ping in the unit tests to test beforehand if the NBA is alive ([issue #19](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/19).
* Check results: `R CMD CHECK` now proceeds without errors, warnings or notes ([issue #20](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/20)).
* Spell-check was done ([issue #22](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/22)).
* Goodpractice results were improved ([issue #21](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/21)). However, it was not possible to cut all lines of code to 80 characters, due to autogenerated code.

**Miscellaneuos** 
* dwca download functions now suppress excessive output ([issue #44](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/44)).
* Much of the duplicated code is now avoided by having rewritten the `fromJSONString` and `fromList` methods in the templates ([issue #33](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/37)).
* Classes now have a `print` method, which lists all members (and their datatypes) and available functions in a nice way ([issue #39](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/39)).
* A `QueryCondition` object can now also be created with a named list ([issue #29](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/29)).
* Warnings for function `geo_age` are now more clear ([issue #48](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/48)).
* Function `find_by_ids` can now also take a vector of ids as argument ([issue #41](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/41)).
* Map of tomatoes now added to tomato vignette ([issue #27](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/27)).
* Reduced R package size etc., ([issue #31](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/31)).

**What I did not do**
* Schematic code example for clients: Since we have now a *Getting Started* using the wrapper functions and instanciating clients is in the advanced parts, I believe this is not necessary anymore ([issue #26](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/26)).
* Returning `data.frame` for `get_distinct_values_per_group` and `count_distinct_values_per_group`. This is now done in the wrappers.
* More ideomatic code for specifying query parameters: I think the way to pass query parameters as a list is sufficient, see also [issue #40](https://github.com/naturalis/nbaR/issues/40).

I hope you agree with me that these changes significantly improved the usage of this package. Thanks again for taking the time to review.

Best, 

Hannes
